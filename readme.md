This started as an SPH test but it's turning into an over-the-top simulation! I want to see how far I can push CPU-based particle-particle interactions. 

If I'm running large code finding nearest neighbors, why not also investigate things like sphere packings? 

If I'm doing SPH in 2 and 3 dimensions, why not 4?

etc. etc. :)
